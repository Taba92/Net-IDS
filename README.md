# IDS

An network IDS written in Erlang.

CURRENTLY IN DEBUGGING BUT FINISHED.

Since the basic dataset is too large to be loaded, it is necessary to insert it after downloading the IDS.
The dataset used is the result of the merge of the various pieces of database available at the following link: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html (see the link at the bottom of the Download dataset page or similar) .
On the graphic window of the IDS there is a "CREA DATASET" button where ,after inserted the folder with the dataset chunks, it will merge and create the necessary data files fot the dataset.



LATER WILL BE ADDED SOME DOCUMENTATION
