# IDS

An network IDS written in Erlang.

CURRENTLY IN DEBUGGING BUT FINISHED.

Since the basic dataset is too large to be loaded, it is necessary to insert it manually after downloading the IDS.
The dataset used is the result of the merge of the various pieces of database available at the following link: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html (see the link at the bottom of the Download dataset page or similar) .
After performing this merge, the resulting dataset must be inserted in the path inside the Ids "System / netDetector / netCore / dbHandler / DbHandler / Dataset /".
I will provide the script that performs this merge automatically given the various pieces.



LATER WILL BE ADDED SOME DOCUMENTATION
